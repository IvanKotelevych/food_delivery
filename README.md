## Website Hosting
FOOD de.ry is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can find the source code and configuration files for the website in the repository [here](https://github.com/IvanKotelevych/food_delivery). GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

FOOD de.ry is hosted using json-server. The website utilizes a JSON file (`user.json`) as a database to store and retrieve data. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Install the json-server package globally by running the command:
  npm install -g json-server

2. Start the json-server and watch the `user.json` file by running the command:
  json-server --watch user.json
  
This command will start the json-server and provide a RESTful API to interact with the `user.json` file.

You can now make requests to the json-server API in your web pages to retrieve and manipulate data in the database.
